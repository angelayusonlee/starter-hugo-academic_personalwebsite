abstract: This research examines how TikTok users conceptualize and engage with
  personalized algorithms on the TikTok platform. Using qualitative methods, we
  analyzed 24 interviews with TikTok users to explore how algorithmic
  personalization processes inform peopleâ€™s understanding of their identities as
  well as shape their orientation to others. Building on insights from our
  qualitative data and previous scholarship on algorithms and identity, we
  propose a novel conceptual model to understand how people think about and
  interact with personalized algorithmic systems. Drawing on the metaphor of
  crystals and their properties, the algorithmic crystal framework is an
  analytic frame that captures user understandings of how personalized
  algorithms (1) interact with user identity by reflecting user self-concepts
  that are both multifaceted and dynamic and (2) shape perspectives on others
  encountered through the algorithm, by orienting users to recognize parts of
  themselves refracted in other users and to experience ephemeral, diffracted
  connections with groups of similar others. We describe how the algorithmic
  crystal framework can extend theory and inform new lines of research around
  the implications of algorithms in self concept development and social life.
